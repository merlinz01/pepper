# Configuration

Both Manager and Agent are configured by means of YAML config files.

> TODO: Once config options stabilize we should document them here.

## Manager

See `redpepper/manager/manager.yml` for more info (should be self-documenting).

## Agent

See `redpepper/manager/agent.yml` for more info (should be self-documenting).
