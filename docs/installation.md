## Installation

Installation is manual for now.

For both Manager and Agent:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/merlinz01/redpepper.git
cd redpepper
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I intend to provide a .deb package and/or a Linux bootstrapper one-liner once I get this project far enough along.
