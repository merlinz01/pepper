## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your project, we recommend following these best practices:

- Keep your TLS private keys secure.
- Don't use self-signed certificates.
- DO NOT use the sample certificates and keys from this repository in production.
- Assign strict IP address ranges for each agent.
- Use a sufficiently large and securely generated pre-shared secret for each agent.
- Keep all dependencies up to date.
- Regularly backup your data.

You can set up your own private Certificate Authority using [Smallstep CA](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates)
for a fairly simple and reliable agent certificate provisioning process.
